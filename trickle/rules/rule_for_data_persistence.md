When implementing data storage and persistence functionality
- Always prioritize backend file storage over client-side storage for critical data
- Implement proper error handling with fallback to mock data when backend is unavailable
- Ensure all card upload/delete operations are immediately persisted to server files
- Provide automatic backup mechanisms to prevent data loss
- Use JSON file format for easy data portability and debugging
- Implement proper API endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Never rely solely on browser storage for important user data
- Always provide clear feedback to users about data save status
- Include data validation before saving to prevent corruption
- Maintain backward compatibility when updating data structures
